## Introduction: The Challenge of Opacity

- Global supply chains often span dozens of countries and suppliers, making product origins hard to trace.
- Critical raw materials (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold) frequently come from conflict zones where forced labor funds armed groups&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- This opacity leads to legal, ethical, and financial risks for companies, especially under strict due-diligence laws.
- Consumers and investors now demand transparency and accountability in sourcing.

## What is ConflictChain?

- A digital platform for end-to-end supply chain mapping and provenance tracking.
- Leverages a permissioned blockchain to record transactions immutably and provide an auditable trail.
- Integrates data from manufacturers, suppliers, auditors, and NGOs into a unified ledger.
- Focuses on traceability of high-risk materials (e.g. minerals, electronic components).

## How does ConflictChain work?

- Suppliers report material movements, certifications, and test results; data is encrypted and uploaded to the network.
- Each transaction triggers a smart contract to validate data format and compliance with standards.
- The blockchain ledger stores tamper-proof provenance records; analytics dashboards visualize supply paths.
- Authorized users can query product history, verify origin certificates, and receive alerts on anomalies.

## Are you sure? (Evidence and Drivers)

- Regulatory requirements: US Dodd-Frank Act (2010) forces public companies to report use of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}; EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (2021) mandates sourcing from conflict-free sources&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Market demands: Major electronics and automotive firms require certified supply chains; NGO investigations frequently uncover undisclosed risks.
- Transparency gap: Industry reports indicate only a minority of companies can fully trace raw materials, underscoring unmet need.
- Trust through data: Immutable records and third-party audits build assurance for regulators, buyers, and communities.

## Can you do it? (Technical Plan)

- Team with domain expertise: supply-chain engineers, blockchain developers, data scientists and legal advisors.
- Technology approach: Build on existing frameworks (e.g. Hyperledger) and open data standards (e.g. GS1, ISO 8000) for interoperability.
- Development roadmap:
  1. Q2 2025: Platform architecture and prototype (data model, smart contracts, UI).
  2. Q3 2025: Pilot launch with selected suppliers (electronic components, minerals) for live testing.
  3. Q4 2025: Full platform release and partnership expansion; incorporate feedback and scaling.
- Collaboration: Engage industry consortiums and NGOs to source data and refine use cases; adapt to regulatory updates.

## What do you want? (Call to Action)

- **Industry Partners:** Manufacturers, mining companies, and certification bodies to join pilot projects and share supply data.
- **Data and Standards:** Organizations to align on data models and help verify material provenance.
- **Investors and Funders:** Support development costs and incentivize growth; enable rapid scaling to global networks.
- **Policymakers and NGOs:** Collaborate on best practices, compliance support, and expanding transparency frameworks.
